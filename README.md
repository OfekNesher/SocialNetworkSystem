# Social Network System

# Introduction:
As part of an OOP in C++ course we were given a task to teach us different elements:
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Operators Overloading
* C++ Standard Library

# Our Project:
Our system is a social network that allows its registered members to communicate with their friends online.

The system allows the user several actions such as:
* Add a friend
* Add a fan page
* Add status to a friend / fan page
* View all fan / fan page statuses
* Friendship link between two members
* Add a fan to a page
* View all entities registered to the system
* View all members of a particular member / fans of a particular page
